# Neural-convolutional-autoencoder
A convolutional autoencoder made in TFLearn.

### Examples
I trained this "architecture" on selfies (256*256 RGB) and terminated the training procedure after one epoch out of sheer excitement.

Here are some results (selfies are taken from google https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&tbm=isch&as_q=selfie&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&safe=images&tbs=itp:face,sur:fmc):
